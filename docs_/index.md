This is currently the fastest BitBuffer for Roblox, and it's currently around 55-75% faster than any of its competition. The API is based on the original module by Stravant, and it is built upon the module made by Defaultio.

This documentation site will show you the API and how you can use it. If you want any features, you can create a pull request or you can create an issue on the GitHub.
